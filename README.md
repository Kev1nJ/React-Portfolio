## Project Structure

The project structure follows a modular approach:

- **src/components**: Contains React components for Header, Navigation, Sections (AboutMe, Portfolio, Contact, Resume), Footer, etc.
- **src/App.jsx**: The main entry point where routing is set up.
- **public/index.html**: The HTML template for the application.

## Features

### 1. Navigation

- The header includes a navigation bar with titles corresponding to different sections of the portfolio.
- Navigation titles: About Me, Portfolio, Contact, Resume.
- The selected title is highlighted based on the current section.

### 2. Section Content

- Each section (About Me, Portfolio, Contact, Resume) is a React component.
- Clicking on a navigation title renders the corresponding section below the navigation without reloading the page.
