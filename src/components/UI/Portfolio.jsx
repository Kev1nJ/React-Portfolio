      Hello, I'm Kevin Jerome, aspiring software developer/engineer with a passion for crafting seamless digital experiences. 
      somewhat proficient in the MERN stack, Ive been honing my skills in MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js, ensuring dynamic and responsive applications. 
      My knowledge extends to leveraging technologies like Bootstrap for polished UIs and navigating RESTful APIs effortlessly. 
      Testing is a crucial part of my workflow, and I employ tools such as Postman and Insomnia to ensure robust functionality. 
      With a desire to expand my toolkit, I am actively delving into Docker, Python, and AWS, driven by a relentless curiosity for cutting-edge technologies. 
      As I continue on this journey, my sights are set on possibly exploring cybersecurity and cloud engineering, anticipating a future where innovation and security go hand in hand.
